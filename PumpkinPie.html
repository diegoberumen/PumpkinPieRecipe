<h2>How to make a Pumpkin Pie</h2>
<p>
    Pumpkin Piess are one of the most exquisite delicacies one can imagine. 
    Make sure you have the following items to begin:
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li style="color:red">and most important, Love.</li>
    </ul> 
</p>
<p>
    Follow these steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a
        time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons). Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold
        together.</li>
        <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch
        thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. Gently roll the
        dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the
        pie pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt with an
        electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is
        inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean.</li>
